💡 Can Artificial Intelligence function as a digital healthcare assistant? This project explores that possibility through the development of an AI-powered Healthcare Chatbot capable of predicting diseases based on user-reported symptoms using Machine Learning algorithms in Python. The system is integrated with a web interface, allowing real-time interaction and accessibility to users. 🩺💻

🔍 Project Overview:
Symptom interpretation using NLP: Applies Natural Language Processing to extract and understand user inputs effectively.

Disease prediction model: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to identify potential diseases from the given symptoms.

Dynamic conversational flow: Adapts follow-up questions based on user responses for a more natural dialogue experience.

Confidence-based output: Provides disease predictions with probability scores to ensure transparency and reliability.

Comprehensive guidance: Offers additional health tips, preventive measures, and motivational insights for improved user engagement.

Web deployment: Developed and deployed using Flask or Streamlit, supported by a front-end built with HTML/CSS.

🎯 Learning Outcomes:
Data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing for medical datasets.

Model training and evaluation for symptom-based disease detection.

Designing interactive chatbots that simulate real healthcare interactions.

Deploying an AI-powered application for seamless online access.
